</abstract>

<toc>

<sect>Introduction
<p>
This is VigMeUp, an alarm clock program for KDE.  It is free (as in freedom) software, developed
by me (Sean) in my spare time.  The latest and greatest versions are available at http://www.c-nix.com/vigmeup or your local KDE, linuxberg, or metalab mirror.
<sect1>Changes
<P>
Since 1.0.1:
I fixed a show stopper.  It is back to using system(), it works well with more mp3 players now.
<p>
Since 1.0.0:
I switched to a cleaner execution scheme using fork and execv.  It works better. I used KFileDialog now, cause it actually works.
Since 0.1.1:
Lots of changes since last time.  I've switched to using KDevelop for its wizard, so everything is more KDE-correct now.
<sect>Installation
<p>
<sect1>How to obtain VigMeUp 
<p>
You can obtain VigMeUp from ftp.kde.org, metlab.unc.edu, their respective mirrors, and of course, the main
site at http://www.c-nix.com/vigmeup
RPMS and Source RPMS for RedHat and SuSE as well as Slackware packages are available.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
You need at least KDE 1.0.  I think you might need KDE 1.1.1, but I'm not sure (sorry).  If VigMeUp 1.0.2 doesn't work for you, use VigMeUp 0.1.1 for KDE 1.0 and VigMeUp 0.7b for KDE Beta4.

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>

In order to compile and install VigMeUp on your system, type the following in
the base directory of the VigMeUp distribution:

<tscreen><verb>
% ./configure
% make
% make install
</verb></tscreen>

<p>
Since VigMeUp uses <verb>autoconf</verb> you should have not trouble
compiling it.
Should you run into problems please report them to the the author at

<sect> Usage <p>
<sect1> General Usage
<p>
The UI for VigMeUp is pretty straight-forward, if you ask me.  It is supposed to look like an alarm clock.
All the functions on the alarm clock are also available on the menu-bar.  Options are saved.  Just choose
your player, choose your song, set the alarm, and go to sleep.  Tomorrow, wake up to some music!


<sect> The Story behind VigMeUp
<p>
A Long time ago in a galaxy far away...
Actually, I met this guy named Jon Viglione, (nickname: Vig) 
who had a terrible time waking up in the morning.
This program is name in honor of him.  (Well, isn't that special!!)

The ultimate irony is he still uses Windows.  But not for long :)

I started developing VigMeUp for Windows back in the day.  Then I hacked together version 0.01 the night
before two final exams here at the University.  Since then, I've been making little improvements.  I use
VigMeUp every morning (or afternoon) to wake up!! It works great for me! :)

<sect>Questions and Answers<p>
If you have questions, ask me (Sean) by emailing me at vigmeup@c-nix.com
No one has asked me any questions (AFAIK) that I think are relavant to everyone.

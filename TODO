TODO, AKA the Vaporware section...

In the next development cycle, I'm going to add CD support.

I'm going to try to make VigMeUp sexier looking. :)
Along these lines, I've accomplished using the QLayout class.
Sorry, it has been a long time since the last released.

I'm going to turn the colon into an image so it scales better.

Also, someone suggested an AM/PM button.

1.0.3 June 18, 2000
Well, stuff is working. I'm now using QLayouts to lay the geometry out
so it looks better when you resize it.  Also, some people were typing
in the name of the player.  It used to only set the player name if you
selected it from the file dialog.  Now it checks it immediately.


1.0.2 August 24, 1999
I did my best to fix the bug that was crippling this software.  I'm really
sorry about this...so now it works with x11amp, kmp3, mpg123, and most likely
others.  If you have another and get a positive report, let me know 
at vigmeup@c-nix.com
	
1.0.1 June 16, 1999
Quick bug fix.  I switched to a fork()/execv() execution of the mp3 player.
It appears to be a little cleaner than before.
Also, back to using KFileDialog, now that it actually works.
1.0.0 June 13, 1999
It's been a long time coming, but here it is, a version of VigMeUp
that is actually stable and KDE standards compliant.  Everything (that
I can think of) works.  The direction I'm taking it now is asthetic,
so don't worry about updating every second or whatever.  I used
KDevelop to bring it up to speed and make it KDE happy.
I changed the license BACK to GPL (From Artistic).
0.1.2 Mid-Winter... (Northern Hemisphere)
This was never released, but 0.1.2 had a bunch of changes that caused
VigMeUp to be very unstable.  I wasn't happy with it.
0.1.1 November 7
Added a spiffy menu bar and changed the snooze bar so
it is blue.  Changed the file dialog back to QFileDialog.  Developers
on the KDE-devel list were (once again) very unhelpful in even
bothering to find a solution to the problem. :(   The problem is that
KFileDialog will translate some special characters (like the
apostrophe) into its unicode equilvalent, like %29 or whatever.  A lot
of times, mp3s have weird names, so this can lead to problems.  If
anyone has any solutions, email me at vigmeup@lowrent.org.

0.1.0 September 3
Changed the CHANGELOG so the most recent are on the top.
Fixed a grammatical error in the CHANGELOG. (I had used errata to refer to one
error.)
Now I have an icon (from 0.07b) and a kdelnk file that will install when make
install runs.
The biggest changes are the new configuration options, ampProgram, and
snoozeLength.  Now YOU can select the program you use to play mp3s (Replay,
tkplay, x11amp, whatever!!) as long as it handles the first file argument as
the mp3.  There is now an on-board dialog to change the snooze length.  Both
of these options are saved with KConfig.
Changed numbering style similar to Linux kernel, this is development 0.1.0.
Use 0.07b if you are worried about stability, however, it still uses x11amp
and a snooze length of 10 minutes, but you can edit the source to change that.
Web pages are up at http://www.c-nix.com/vigmeup
Announced to freshmeat.net

0.07b August 05
Wonderful. Finally! Use KConfig and it works!
Last mp3 is saved and loaded on start up.
Also, KFileDialog is used instead of QFileDialog
This is the first version that is being released onto the net.

0.06b July 30
Read Forbes article on Free Software.
Fixes bug where /dev/dsp is locked by your amp program.
Fixed a scroll bar bug.

0.05b
Added a fixed width to the main dialog.

0.04b
Added mp3 Filter
Uses and needs KDE. This is a KDE Application, not a qt application.
Still depends on Qt though.

0.03b Bug Fixing, feature adding
Fixed space in file name errors.
Fixed apostrophe in file name errors.
Supports all file names now.

0.02b Secondary design
File selection enabled. Fill select any file and attempt to play it using x11amp. Therefore, a filter is needed.
Erratum: File names with an apostrophe (') will cause the system call to choke
and the alarm will not go off.

0.01b Initial Design Jun 11 1998. Night before two finals.
Alarm Clock like. Qt dependent. Doesn't need kde.
